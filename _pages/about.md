Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Geography & Geographic Information Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I work with Dr. Chunyuan Diao at the Remote Sensing Space-Time Innovation Lab.

My research lies at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. Specifically, I focus on using remote sensing techniques to monitor and understand ecosystem dynamics under climate change. My work integrates multi-scale remote sensing platforms (satellites, near-surface platforms, drones) with field data collection to enhance our understanding of agricultural, forest, and coastal ecosystems.

Currently, I am involved in projects ranging from crop type mapping and phenology characterization to the remote monitoring of agricultural practices and modeling the impacts of climate change on various ecosystems.

Prior to joining UIUC, I worked with Dr. Meha Jain and earned dual Master of Science degrees in Data Science and Natural Resources and Environment from the University of Michigan. I earned Bachelor of Engineering in Remote Sensing Science and Technology from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan).
