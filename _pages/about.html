I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Geography &amp; Geographic Information Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I work with Dr. Chunyuan Diao at the Remote Sensing Space-Time Innovation Lab.</p> <p>My research lies at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. Specifically, I focus on using remote sensing techniques to monitor and understand ecosystem dynamics under climate change. My work integrates multi-scale remote sensing platforms (satellites, near-surface platforms, drones) with field data collection to enhance our understanding of agricultural, forest, and coastal ecosystems.</p> <p>Currently, I am involved in projects ranging from crop type mapping and phenology characterization to the remote monitoring of agricultural practices and modeling the impacts of climate change on various ecosystems.</p> <p>Prior to joining UIUC, I worked with Dr. Meha Jain and earned dual Master of Science degrees in Data Science and Natural Resources and Environment from the University of Michigan. I earned Bachelor of Engineering in Remote Sensing Science and Technology from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan).</p> </body></html>
