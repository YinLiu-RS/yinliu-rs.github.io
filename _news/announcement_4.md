I won the second place in the <a href='http://www.aagrssg.org/student-honors-paper-competition/' target='_blank'><strong>Student Honors Paper Competition</strong></a> in the AAG Annual Meeting (2025), organized by the Remote Sensing Specialty Group (RSSG). My paper presentation is “A novel Harvest Phenology Index (HPI) for corn and soybean harvesting date mapping using Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery on Google Earth Engine”.
